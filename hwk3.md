1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
   But for multiples of 4 print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of 6 print "Buzz". 
   For numbers which are multiples of both 4 and 6 print "FizzBuzz".
   (don't just modify your old code - start from scratch)

2. Write a function that wins at rock paper scissors. 
 - It should take one string as argument, and return the corresponding winning string.
 
3. Write a function `isEven` that takes a number and returns `true` or `false`. 

4. Write a function `is5` that returns `true` if a number is 5 and `false` otherwise

5. Write a function `factorial` that takes a number and returns the factorial of that number. 
 - For example `factorial(3)` should return `6`. 
 - What is the factorial of 500?

6. Write a function `capitalise` that takes a word and capitalises it
 - for example `capitalise("hello") should return "Hello"`.

7. Write a function `triangle` that takes a number and returns the sum of all the numbers up to that number. 
 - (these are called triangle numbers in mathematics)

8. Write a function `reverseString` that takes a string and reverses it.

9. Write a function `endRev` that takes a string and returns the last 3 letters in reverse order. 
 - for example `endrev("daredevil")` should return `"liv"`.
   
10. Write a function `timeDiff` that takes two strings representing times, and returns the time in minutes between them.
 - for example `time_diff('1345', '1500')` should return 75.
